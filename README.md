<h3 align="center">Example: automatic MP3 analysis</h3>

![Automatic MP3 flyover and ranked aircraft search](docs/assets/livermore-automatic-mp3.png)

<sub>Historical example before the current aircraft-type policy: automatic MP3 analysis selected 466 aircraft and ranked 105 candidate locations. The first candidate was **476 m from reference** in a constrained geographic search and clock window. [Experiment and ranking](docs/LIVERMORE_DEMO.md#all-aircraft-archive-mp3-ranking).</sub>

## Capabilities

| Capability | What DOPPLERGEIST provides |
| --- | --- |
| **Automatic acoustic discovery** | Scans an entire recording for moving frequency tracks and groups related harmonics, without manually selecting event windows or frequency bands. |
| **Historical aircraft data** | Acquires and indexes ADSB.lol flight archives; caches reusable trajectory, terrain, and geoid inputs. |
| **Location search** | Compares predicted Doppler and sound-arrival patterns across candidate receiver locations, including evidence from multiple independent flyovers. |
| **Geographic profiles** | Search profiles for the contiguous United States, Germany, Spain, metropolitan France (including Corsica), and Italy (including Sicily and Sardinia), plus generated bounding envelopes for every other country and territory, grouped by continent ([COUNTRIES.md](docs/COUNTRIES.md)), with optional user-provided regional bounds. |
| **Local browser application** | Recording uploads, persistent analysis jobs, per-curve spectrogram/audio evidence, false-positive review with user-assisted re-analysis, progress monitoring, and supported resume/cancellation workflows. |
| **Research and reproducibility** | Configured measurement/replay commands, documented experiments, diagnostic artifacts, and decision rules for unresolved searches. |

The integrated application and command-line workflow are available on `main`. See [how it works](#how-it-works) and [validation and results](#validation-and-results) for the distinction between a ranked hypothesis and an accepted location.

## Quickstart

Install the [published PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/dopplergeist/) with `pipx`. It requires Python 3.11+; Intel Macs require Python 3.11–3.13. Install **FFmpeg** separately and make sure that `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are on your `PATH`.

The full CLI and browser workflow require Linux or macOS. On native Windows,
the published wheels support `discover` only; `analyze`, `serve`, and `job`
depend on POSIX facilities and fail to start. Windows users can run the full
workflow inside WSL with Linux, Python, and FFmpeg installed there.

```bash
pipx install dopplergeist
dopplergeist --help
```

To install in an existing Python environment instead, use `python -m pip install dopplergeist`. The commands below work with either installation. See the [PyPI and packaging guide](docs/PYPI.md).

Before starting a long analysis, check your local installation:

```bash
dopplergeist doctor --jobs jobs
```

This offline check runs FFmpeg/ffprobe, imports runtime libraries in an isolated
process, verifies the packaged interface, and inspects available job storage
without creating directories. Use `--json` for structured output. Errors return
exit code 1; storage warnings alone return 0. The 20 GiB warning threshold is
advisory: large searches can require more, and custom cache storage needs a
separate capacity check. Passing does not establish flight-data coverage or
geolocation accuracy.

### Option A: use the browser interface

```bash
dopplergeist serve --jobs jobs --online --max-runtime 14400 --port 8765
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8765** and upload a recording. For historical flight matching, supply a supported UTC time window for the **first audio sample**. The interface runs locally; `--online` permits downloading public aircraft and terrain data.

 
![DOPPLERGEIST local browser application with the upload form and analysis panel](docs/assets/browser-ui.jpg)

<sub>Actual local browser interface before an upload. The analysis panel fills after a job runs; see the real MP3 demonstration above for ranked locations.</sub>

### Option B: analyze a recording from the CLI

```bash
dopplergeist analyze path/to/recording.mp3 --jobs jobs
```

This command creates a job and analyzes the audio. Historical flight matching requires `--start-utc`, `--end-utc`, and an evidence-based `--time-source`. Add `--online` to acquire missing public data. Without a reliable recording time, the job returns `needs_input`.

A full online regional analysis includes data acquisition and geographic search. The job limit defaults to **one hour**. Initial data acquisition can take longer. The example below uses sample times and Berlin bounds. Replace them with evidence for your recording and adjust `--max-runtime` for the expected workload:

```bash
dopplergeist analyze path/to/recording.mp3 \
  --start-utc "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --end-utc "2026-01-01T00:10:00Z" \
  --time-source "replace with the source establishing the first-sample clock" \
  --country DE --bounds 13.0 52.0 14.0 53.0 \
  --online --max-runtime 21600
```

To check progress after the job ID is printed:

```bash
dopplergeist job JOB_ID --jobs jobs --watch
```

The progress percentage is stage-based and can remain unchanged during long tile subdivisions. Recent search-file activity is a liveness clue, not proof that the queue is shrinking or that a location was found.

The default country profile is `US` (contiguous United States). Other profiles include Germany (`DE`), Spain (`ES`), metropolitan France including Corsica (`FR`), and Italy including Sicily and Sardinia (`IT`). Spain, France, and Italy use broad geographic envelopes without country polygons. For regional searches, set independently justified `--bounds WEST SOUTH EAST NORTH`. The France profile excludes overseas territories. See [country profiles](docs/COUNTRIES.md) and the [browser workflow](docs/PRODUCT.md) for configuration and job management.

**Data requirements:** Initial online acquisition may take hours and tens of gigabytes of disk space, depending on the recording time and search region. Downloads and caches are reusable; the application does not enforce an automatic disk-space cap.

### Option C: discover acoustic events without flight data

```bash
dopplergeist discover \
  path/to/recording.mp3 \
  --output results/my-discovery
```

Discovery uses the same detector as automatic analysis. It decodes the recording at two sample rates, groups related measured tracks into acoustic proposals, and retains the individual tracks for subsequent analysis. A proposal alone does not establish aircraft identity.

This scans the full recording locally without downloading ADS-B archives. Inspect `results/my-discovery/summary.json` and the saved `discovery/` diagnostics. See [Automatic audio discovery](docs/AUDIO_DISCOVERY.md) for detector details and options.

For configured research workflows, `dopplergeist run` and `dopplergeist measure` remain available; see [Methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md).

### Install from source (developers)

To work on the repository, clone the source and install it in a virtual environment. These commands use Linux or macOS paths:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1337isnot1337/DOPPLERGEIST.git
cd DOPPLERGEIST
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install .
.venv/bin/dopplergeist --version
```

A compatible C compiler enables optional native acceleration. Python fallbacks are available. See [Setup](docs/SETUP.md), [Performance](docs/PERFORMANCE.md), and [Docker](docs/DOCKER.md) for more options.

## How it works

1. **Detect the signal.** Decode the recording, identify moving spectral tracks, and group harmonics that may belong to one flyover.
2. **Prepare flight history.** Retrieve or load aircraft trajectories for the recording's supported time window, tracking gaps in available data.
3. **Predict the audio.** Model Doppler shifts and sound-arrival delays from flight paths, receiver geometry, and acoustic propagation.
4. **Rank locations.** Compare modeled and observed signals across geographic candidates and multiple flyovers; preserve alternative explanations when evidence is insufficient.

The software records diagnostic evidence and can return an inconclusive result rather than selecting an unsupported coordinate. The underlying models are described in [Methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) and [Confidence and decision rules](docs/CONFIDENCE.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### Is Colsto's airplane Doppler geolocation code available?

Colsto did not release the original tools or source code from his [aircraft Doppler geolocation demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytYrhYLOKI).

**DOPPLERGEIST is an independent implementation**, inspired by the approach in that video. It contains independently written code and is not affiliated with Colsto. If you want to experiment with aircraft Doppler signatures and historical flight-track matching, you can install and run DOPPLERGEIST locally.

### Can I geolocate an MP3 recording?

DOPPLERGEIST accepts MP3 recordings and can automatically detect candidate aircraft Doppler events. With a justified recording-time window and appropriate flight data, it can search and rank possible recording locations. A successful location determination is not guaranteed.

### Do I need to know when the recording was made?

**Yes, for historical flight matching.** The software needs a defensible UTC time or bounded time window for the first audio sample. Without that information, it can still analyze the sound, but geographic matching returns `needs_input`.

### Can DOPPLERGEIST run offline?

**Yes, for acoustic discovery.** Location search also works with appropriately configured historical flight and terrain data already available locally. The `--online` flag allows the program to acquire missing public data.

### How accurate is DOPPLERGEIST?

In a constrained real-MP3 demonstration, the highest-ranked location was **476 m from an inferred reference**, not a surveyed microphone position. Independent blind accuracy on real recordings has not yet been established. See [validation and results](#validation-and-results) for both successful fits and unsuccessful evaluations.

### Can I upload an audio file in a browser?

**Yes.** Run `dopplergeist serve` after installation and open the local interface. It is a self-hosted application, not a public cloud upload service.

### Is DOPPLERGEIST free and open source?

DOPPLERGEIST is **source-available, not OSI-approved open source**. It is licensed under [PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](LICENSE), which permits use, modification, and distribution for permitted noncommercial purposes, subject to its terms. Commercial use outside those permissions requires separate authorization; see [Commercial licensing](docs/COMMERCIAL-LICENSING.md).

## Validation and results

DOPPLERGEIST has been exercised on synthetic fixtures, real aircraft recordings, historical flight tracks, and browser/API workflows. These experiments demonstrate components of the pipeline; **no independently accepted blind real-recording localization has yet been established**.

| Experiment | Observed result | How to interpret it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Historical Livermore MP3, prior all-aircraft policy** | Selected and searched 466 nearby aircraft and returned 105 ranked locations; the first was **476 m from an inferred reference**. | Fully automatic event selection, but a constrained region and approximate 10-second clock window; the reference is not surveyed truth and the result was inconclusive. [Details](docs/LIVERMORE_DEMO.md#all-aircraft-archive-mp3-ranking). |
| **Configured two-flyover real-audio replay** | Leading location **43.86 m from a public reference**. | Used source-informed events and geographic bounds; the reference is not surveyed, and the model did not accept a location. [Clean replay](docs/verification/CLEAN_REPLAY.md). |
| **40 real smartphone aircraft recordings** | Automatic discovery produced candidate acoustic groups in **36 of 40** files. | These are acoustic proposals, not verified aircraft detections or geolocation successes. [Discovery results](docs/AUDIO_DISCOVERY.md). |
| **Five public field recordings** | Three returned rankings, with no retained candidate within 1 km of the publisher-reported sites; two returned no candidate. | Recorder clocks and exact microphone positions were not confirmed, so these are development outcomes rather than a calibrated accuracy benchmark. [Experiment](docs/PUBLIC_RECORDING_EXPERIMENT_2026-11-03.md). |
| **NASA and WSU measured-trajectory recordings** | Produced mixed detection results and no validated automatic location. | Original real-data tests, including unsuccessful cases. [Verification](docs/verification/WORKER_E2E_2026-11-03.md) and [NASA benchmark](benchmarks/README.md#real-nasa-supplied-trajectory-session-benchmark). |

Searches depend on acoustic evidence, reliable recording-time information, sufficient historical flight coverage, and physical-model support. A ranked score is not a calibrated location probability, and incomplete or competing hypotheses may lead to an **inconclusive** decision. Full experimental conditions, negative findings, and reproducibility records remain available in the linked reports.

### Performance engineering

Optional native backends, reuse of acoustic calculations, and checkpointed search are implemented and measured. In one pinned bounded regional HTTP replay, optimizations reduced elapsed time from **62.03 seconds to 37.19 seconds (1.67×)** without changing the compared scientific outputs. This is a workload-specific result, not a general national-search runtime claim. See [measured performance and reproduction](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#measured-native-computation-and-bounded-reuse) and [data/search architecture](docs/DATA_AND_SCALE.md).
